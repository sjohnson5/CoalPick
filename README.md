# CoalPick

This is an example script for basic usage of the CNN created by Ross et al. (2018)
on MIS data mentioned in Johnson et al. (2020). As well as optimizing a Baer picker in a similar format.

## Installation

You must first install [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html).5DGFJB

Next, clone CoalPick.
```bash
clone https://github.com/sjohnson5/CoalPick
```
and cd into the newly created CoalPick directory.
```bash
cd CoalPick
```
Now download the data from the following dataverse repo:
(https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/5DGFJB)
and put the data.parquet file into the CoalPick directory.


Then create a conda environment using the provided environment.yml file:
```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```
Now run the example_code.py script.
```bash
python example_code.py
```
It will generate some plots in the `plots` directory.

The example_code.py script is well documented and should provide an easy
way to adopt the code to run on your own.
